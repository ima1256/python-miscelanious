# Python Miscelanious

Through this broad project I tested different things that one can do with python like like for example read a book translating it page by page using the web ChatGPT 

interface and automating the keyboard interaction with the payperclip and keyboard python libraries. 

Other things that I've done has being some website scrapping combining the python library for HTML parsing playwright with the ChatGPT API and the Google Places API.
